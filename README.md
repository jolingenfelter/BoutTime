# BoutTime

A simple game app where the user has a minute to put a list of events related to Pixar movies in order by year.  When complete, the user shakes the device to see if the events are ordered correctly, and they can then tap on the events to view more information about them in a webView.  This project uses AudioToolbox for sound effects and a plist to store the information related to the events.
